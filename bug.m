This bug arises when dealing with Objective-C's KVO (Key-Value Observing) mechanism.  Specifically, it occurs when an observer is added to an object that's already deallocated. This leads to a crash or unexpected behavior because the observer attempts to access memory that no longer exists.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyObject deallocated");
}
@end

// In another class:
MyObject *myObj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[myObj addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"myString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:nil];

// ... some time later ...
myObj = nil; // MyObject is released

// ... later still ...
[myObj setValue:@"new value" forKey:@
