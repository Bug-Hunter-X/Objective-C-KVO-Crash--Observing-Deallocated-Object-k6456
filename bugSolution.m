The solution involves ensuring that observers are removed before the observed object is deallocated.  This is typically done within the object's `dealloc` method:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)dealloc {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"myString"];
    NSLog(@"MyObject deallocated");
}
@end

//In your observer class:
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    //Handle your observation
}

// Alternatively, if you manage observation in a different place:
[myObj removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"myString"];
myObj = nil;
```

By calling `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` before the object is deallocated, you prevent the KVO mechanism from trying to access memory that is no longer valid.
